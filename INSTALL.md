Installation Instructions for Terming
=====================================

1. Ensure you have Go installed on your system. You can download it from the [official Go website](https://golang.org/dl/).

2. Clone the `terming` repository from GitHub:

   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/terming.git
   ```

3. Navigate to the cloned repository directory:

   ```sh
   cd terming
   ```

4. If the project includes a `Makefile`, you can usually build and install the project using the `make` command. The specific `make` targets would depend on what is defined in the `Makefile`. For example:

   ```sh
   make build
   ```

   This would compile the project according to the instructions in the `Makefile`.

5. To install the binaries or tools that were built, you might use:

   ```sh
   make install
   ```

   Again, this depends on the targets defined in the `Makefile`.

6. After installation, you can use the `timg` tool from the command line, assuming it has been installed in a directory that's in your system's PATH.

Note: Replace `your-username` with the actual username where the repository is hosted.
